# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview
In this analysis, Kickstarter data is analyzed through the lens of an individual fundraising for a theatrical production. This analysis observes the relationship between the outcomes of fundraising campaigns for various plays, whether they were successful, failed, or canceled, and the month when they were launched. This project also looks at the relationship between the fundraising goals for all play campaigns, and of those campaigns, what percent  were successful, what percent were failed, and what percent were canceled. By analyzing the time of year fundraising campaigns were launched, and whether campaigns were successful in fundraising their goals, this project aims to a paint a picture of the optimal conditionas needed to launch a successful fundraising campaign for a theatre production.

## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis was preformed using microsoft Excel. First, the data was observed. When looking at the data, the category and subcategories were grouped together in a single column (column N). This presented a problem because in order to gather specific information about plays, "plays" needed to be isolated as a criteria. This presented the challenge of separating the column into a category (parent) column and a subcategory column.  This was achieved by selecting column N, navigating to the data tab on the ribbon, and selecting the ”Text to Columns” button, followed by the execution of prompts

Next, a pivot table using the data set was created to show for each month, how many were successful, how many failed, and how many were canceled. The data was filtered to show only the theatre category and visualized using a line graph.

Finally, a chart and accompanying line graph were created to capture the outcomes of various theatrical production campaigns based on their goals. Goals were defined in tiers that increased in value by $5000. In order to count the number of plays, a formula needed to be written to look at each row, decide if the row is relevant to theatre plays, and if it is, look at the goal, and decide which tier the goal belonged to. This was a challenge that was accomplished using the ifs function. The total number of projects for each tier was summed, and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns were calculated and visualized in the accompanying graph.![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106559768/175072993-60540957-b422-4182-b589-7372b9adc8b8.png)


## Results
The graph “Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date” measures the number of successful, failed and canceled fundraising campaigns between 2009 – 2017.  This data shows that over a period of 8 years, May has historically been the most successful month to launch a campaign. It also shows the following months, June and July also have the second and third highest rates of success respectively, indicating that the summer is the great time to launch a campaign. Inversely, the graph shows less favorable times to launch a campaign. Through the fall and winter the number of successful theatre campaigns trend downward. In the month of December, only 37 campaigns succeeded; that is one third of the number of successful plays as May. Additionally, roughly the same number of theatre campaigns failed as the ones that succeeded December. From these pieces of information, the data indicates December is the least favorable time to launch a campaign. 

The “Outcomes Based on Goals” graph focuses on data gathered about the subcategory, plays. For each tier of financial goals, the graph measures what percent of projects successfully crowdsourced their goals, what percent failed to meet their goal, and what percent of projects canceled their fundraising effort. As the value of the goal increases, the percent successful projects decrease, and the percent of failed projects increases.  This relationship demonstrates as the budget goes up, the more challenging it is to fundraise the full goal. Although the ”Outcomes Based on Goals” graph peaks around $35,000, an important consideration is that the median data lies in the less than $5000 range, meaning for half of the data collected, the highest rates of success occurred when the goal was less than $5000. The inability of the graph to represent the distribution of outcomes is a limitation of the graph. 

A limitation of this data set that should be considered is that 13 different currency types represented. This presents a problem when monetary columns are formatted as currency, because it assumes the values are US dollars. Because different currency types hold differing economic value, comparing values from countries that use different currency types could be misrepresented. The color scale in the percent funded column could be misleading. The color scale paints a picture of the how funded a project was compared to all the other projects; some projects, escpecially those in the music industry, were funded by 2x, 3x, even 10x the goal. Because some projects were so wildly successful, the gradient is skewed toward higher values, making certain projects, which are completely funded, seem under funded by comparison based on the color of the cell.   

Other graphs that might prove useful for this analysis might include a box and whiskers plot to show the distribution of goals for the successful, unsuccessful, and canceled categories. In terms of planning, it could also be useful to include a graph showing the duration of various campaigns to see if the length of time a fundraising campaign was active affects its rate of success. Finally, A graph of average pledges for successful and unsuccessful campaigns might be a useful tool in creating a strategy to effectively canvas for donations.
